UC Berkeley is the No. 1 public school in the country â€” tied with UCLA, according to the newest American college rankings by U.S. News and World Report.

The celebratory news comes after a remarkable few years at Berkeley, including two Nobel Prize wins for sitting faculty and a record-breaking fundraising campaign that is well on the way to raising $6 billion for the public campus.

U.S. News and World Report has also regularly called UC Berkeley the top public university in the world.

Across the University of California system, every single undergraduate campus was ranked among the top 100 public and private universities. UC Berkeley and UCLA tied at No. 20, followed by UC Santa Barbara (No. 32), UC Irvine and UC San Diego (tied for No. 34), UC Davis (No. 38), UC Santa Cruz (No. 83), UC Riverside (No. 89) and UC Merced (No. 97).
